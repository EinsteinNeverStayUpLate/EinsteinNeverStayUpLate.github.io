<li>as…as</li>
</ol>
<p>Any sentences using the structure <strong>as…as</strong> can rewrite a sentence with <strong>than</strong>. And the meaning doesn’t change.</p>
<ul>
<li>The city center wasn’t as crowded this morning as it usually is. (subject + verb after the second as)</li>
<li>I don’t know as many people as you do. (<strong>between the first and the second as ,it’s many+ noun, usually it should be a adj or adv, many/much+ noun can be an exception.</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: It’s not necessary that after the second as , it must be subject +verb. Such as:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Let’s walk. It’s just as quick as taking the bus.</li>
</ul>
<p>as soon as possible is common:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you send me the money as soon as possible, please? (<strong>Usually, it’s put in the end of sentence).</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ol start="2">
<li>Another form: twice as…as , three times as…as etc:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Petrol is twice as expensive as it was a few years age.</li>
<li>Their house is about three times as big as ours. </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>the same as</strong> is usual, but remember, between ‘same’ and ‘as’, it should be noun.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Ann’s salary is the same as mine.          or           Ann gets the same salary as me.</li>
<li>Tom is the same age as George.</li>
<li>‘What would you like to drink?’      ‘I’ll have the same as you.’</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ol start="4">
<li>As (reason and time), here ‘as ‘ is a conjunction</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>As (reason): As sometimes means ‘because’:</p>
<ul>
<li>As it was a public holiday, all the shops were shut. (=because it was a public holiday)</li>
<li>As the live near us, we see them quite often.</li>
<li>We watched television all evening as we had nothing better to do.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>As(time):  more complicated than above.</p>
<ul>
<li>you can say that something happened as you were doing something else (= in the middle of doing something else):<ul>
<li>Jill slipped as she was getting off the bus.</li>
<li>The thief was seen as he was climbing over the wall.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Most often we use as when two short actions happen at the same time:<ul>
<li>George arrived as Sue left. (=he arrived and Sue left at the same time)</li>
<li>We all waved goodbye to Liz as she drove away in her car.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But we also use as when two things happen together <strong>over at longer period of time</strong>:<ul>
<li>As the day went on, the weather got worse.</li>
<li>I began to enjoy the job more as I got used to it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can also use just as (=exactly at that moment): <ul>
<li>Just as I sat down, the phone rang.</li>
<li>Just as we were going out, it started to ran.</li>
<li>I had to leave just as the conversation was getting interesting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li>We use <strong>as(time)</strong> for actions and happenings. <strong>As</strong> + <strong><em>a situation</em></strong> (not an action) usually means ‘because’:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>As we were asleep, we didn’t hear the doorbell. (=because we were asleep)</li>
<li>As I walked into the room, the phone started ringing. (at the same time)</li>
<li>As they live near me, I see them quite often. (=because they live near me)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ol start="6">
<li>Another use: We use <strong>as</strong> before a subject + verb:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>I didn’t move anything. I left everything as I found it.</li>
<li>They did as they promised.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also say <strong>as you know/as I said/ as she expected/ as I thought etc:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As you know, it’s Tom’s birthday next week. (‘As part’ is put in the head)</li>
<li>Jane failed her driving test, as she expected.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ol start="7">
<li>Note that we say <strong>as usual / as always:</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>You’re late as usual.</li>
</ul>
