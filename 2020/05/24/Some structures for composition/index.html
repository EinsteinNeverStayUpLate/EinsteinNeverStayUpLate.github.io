<li>It’s time you did something = you should have done it already or started  it. <strong>We often use this structure to criticize or complain:</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>It’s 10 o’clock and he’s still in bed. It’s time  he got up.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You’re very selfish. It’s high time you realized that you’re not the most important person in the world. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ol start="2">
<li>If…should…:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>If Tom should phone while I’m out, tell him I’ll phone him back later. (<em>If Tom should phone</em> is similar to <em>if Tom phones</em> .With should, the speaker feels that the possibility is <strong>smaller</strong> )</li>
<li>I’ve left the washing outside. If it should rain, can you bring it in?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>You can also put should at the beginning of these sentences (Should something happen… ):</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Should Tom phone, can you tell him I’ll phone him back later?</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ol start="3">
<li>You can use <strong>any</strong> and <strong>no</strong> + comparatives (any longer/no bigger etc.):</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>I’ve waited long enough. I’m not waiting <strong>any longer</strong></li>
<li>We expected their house to be very big  but it’s no bigger than ours.</li>
<li>Yesterday you said you felt ill. Do you feel any better today?</li>
<li>This hotel is better than the other one and it’s no more expensive.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ol start="4">
<li><p><strong>may</strong>  and <strong>might</strong></p>
<p>We use <strong>may</strong> or <strong>might</strong> to say that something is a possibility. Usually you can use may or might, so you can say:</p>
<ul>
<li>It may be true. or  It might be true.</li>
<li>She might know. or She may know.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the past we use <strong>may have (done)</strong> or <strong>might have (done)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A: I wonder why Kay didn’t answer the phone.</p>
<p>B: She <strong>may have</strong> been asleep. (= perhaps you left it in the shop).</p>
</li>
<li><p>A: I can’t find my bag anywhere.</p>
<p>B: You <strong>might have</strong> left it in the shop. (= perhaps you left it in the shop).</p>
</li>
<li><p>A: I was surprised that Sarah wasn’t  at the meeting.</p>
<p>B: She <strong>might not have</strong> known about it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A: I wonder why Colin was in such a bad mood yesterday.</p>
<p>B: He <strong>may not have</strong> been feeling well.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>should</strong> and <strong>should have (done)</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>should</strong>: We use <strong>should</strong> when something is not right or what we expect. <strong><em>OR</em></strong> We use should to say that we expect something to happen:<ul>
<li>Those boys shouldn’t be playing football at this time. They should be at school. </li>
<li>She’s been studying hard for the exam, so she should pass.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>should have (done)</strong>:  ‘You should have done something’ = <strong>you didn’t do it</strong> but it would have been the right thing to do:<ul>
<li>I’m feeling sick. I <strong>shouldn’t have eaten</strong> so much chocolate.</li>
<li>I wonder why they ‘re so late. They <strong>should have been here</strong> an hour ago.</li>
</ul>

<ol start="6">
<li>Subjunctive Structures (虚拟语气结构)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>If sb did … , sb would do something. ** We are talking about the **present</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If I found a wallet in the street, I would take it to the police.<br>  (NOTE: Here, I am not thinking about a <strong>real</strong> possibility; I’m <strong>imagining</strong> the situation and doesn’t expect to find a wallet in the street.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>I’d be very frightened if somebody pointed a gun at me.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>if sb had done something, sb would have done something.</strong>  It’s like the above structure, but we are talking about the <strong>past</strong> at this moment.</p>
<ul>
<li>If he had been looking where he was going , he wouldn’t have walked into the wall.</li>
<li>The view was wonderful. If I had had a camera, I would have taken some photographs. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ol start="7">
<li>about wish …. next time to note…</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<ol start="8">
<li>would like to have done something (=I regret now that I <strong>didn’t</strong> or I <strong>couldn’t</strong> do something):</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>It’s a pity we didn’t see Val when we were in London. I <strong>would like to have seen</strong> her again.</li>
<li>We’d like to have gone on holiday but we didn’t have enough money.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Also: You can use the same structure after would love/ would hate/ would prefer</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Although would love/hate/prefer are usually followed by to (infinitive), would mind is followed by -ing</em></strong>  </p>
<hr>
<ol start="9">
<li>Something needs doing = <strong>something needs to be done</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The batteries in the radio need changing. (=they need to be changed)</li>
<li>Do you think my jacket needs cleaning?  (=…needs to be cleaned)</li>
<li>It’s a difficult problem. It needs thinking about very carefully.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ol start="10">
<li>We often use hardly +any/anybody/anyone/anything/anywhere:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>A: How much money have you got?</p>
<p>B: <strong>Hardly any.</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>I’ll have to go shopping. We’ve got <strong>hardly any</strong> food.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The exam results were very bad. <strong>Hardly anybody</strong> in our class passed.</p>

<hr>
<ol start="11">
<li><strong>in case</strong> AND <strong>in case of</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Ann might phone tonight. I don’t want to go out in case she phones.(because it’s possible she will phone)</li>
<li>I’ll draw a map for you in case you can’t find our house.(=because it’s possible you won’t be able to find it)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>We use just in case for a smaller possibility</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I don’t think it will rain but I’ll take an umbrella just in case.(=just in case it rains)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>in case of is not the same as in case. In case of …=’if there is’  (especially in notices etc)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>In case of fire, please leave the building as quickly as possible.</li>
<li>In case of emergency, telephone this number.</li>
